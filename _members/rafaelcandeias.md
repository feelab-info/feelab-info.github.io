My name is Rafael Candeias, natural from Portugal, living in Lisbon, and
23 years old.
I am finishing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering,
with a double major in AI and Data Science in November of 2023.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects that
have a positive impact in the world. My life's goal is to enhance human
life quality without compromising our planet's health, either by
optimising services, or discovering and implementing revolutionary ideas.
