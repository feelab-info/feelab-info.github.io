Welcome to the Programming Group!
We are part of the [Institute of Computer Science (ICS)](https://ics.unisg.ch/){: target="_blank"} at the [University of St. Gallen (HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/){: target="_blank"}
and have a branch at the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/){: target="_blank"}.
Together we enjoy working on **Programming Languages**
and **Software Engineering**, including languages and architectures for
**Distributed Systems**, **Reactive Programming**, **DevOps Organizations**, and **Secure Software Systems**.
