### About the AHEAD Project

The AHEAD project aims to develop a simulation environment for optimally locating electric vehicle charging stations and efficiently using power grid resources in urban and rural areas. Using AI models, it includes spatial and power grid layers to place chargers where they are needed and where the grid can support them.
